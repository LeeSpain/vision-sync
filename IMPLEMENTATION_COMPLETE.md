âœ… **Complete payment options system implemented successfully!**

The admin "Add New Project" form now includes all the new pricing fields and works with the enhanced payment system. The database migration added support for:

- **deposit_amount** - Initial deposit payment
- **service_monthly** - Monthly service fee 
- **installment_plans** - JSON array of installment options
- **ownership_options** - JSON object for ownership preferences
- **payment_methods** - JSON array of available payment methods

All forms (templates, projects, and inquiries) are now connected and support the complete range of payment options: one-time purchase, monthly subscription, deposit + service, installments, and service contracts.

The homepage displays flexible pricing options and the admin interface allows full control over all payment methods for each project.
